# Tests requiring a repository

These are further divided into tests requiring a writable vs read-only repository.

* [writeable/](writeable/README.md)
* [read_only/](read_only/README.md)

These tests use a zipped up repository, unzipped to a temporary directory. The scope is `"package"` for [read_only/](read_only/README.md) and `"function"` for _writeable/_.

Data for the tests lives in:

* [data/](data/README.md)
